# Sales and Supply Chain Performance Optimization
Analysis of retail sales, transfers, and warehouse operations to optimize supply chain performance, track sales trends, and improve stock and supplier management. 

### DATA FEATURES
Month: Indicates the time frame for the sales, transfers, and warehouse operations

Supplier: Name of the supplier providing the items

Item Description: Detailed description of the product

Item Type: The type of product

Retail Sales: Sales generated through retail channels

Retail Transfers: Number of items transferred between retail stores

Warehouse Sales: Sales made directly from the warehouse

### SUMMARY
#### Sales Performance:
- The analysis shows that the warehouse generates higher sales (79.84%) than retail channels (20.16%). This could be due to bulk purchasing, lower prices, or operational efficiency in the warehouse.
- The first (34.82%) and third (49.67%) quarters have recorded more sales. This indicates seasonality or high demand for specific products.

#### Retail Transfers and Supply Chain Efficiency:
- My analysis shows a clear positive correlation between retail sales and retail transfers. As retail sales increase, retail transfers tend to increase as well.
- The current transfer system appears to function efficiently because retail transfers effectively meet demands.

#### Suppliers Analysis 
- I found out that we have many suppliers compared to the limited product types we distribute. This is because each product or item type is sourced from multiple brands.
- We also have numerous suppliers providing various product brands that are not in demand or being purchased.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
I propose we focus on suppliers offering popular and high-performing brands and lay off suppliers providing underperforming or non-selling brands.
- We should focus on the best-selling brands within each product, reducing inventory clutter and improving sales efficiency.
- All warehouses should always be well stocked with high-demand items.
To boost retail sales, we should consider improving the in-store experience, delivery time, and customer satisfaction at each retail store.
