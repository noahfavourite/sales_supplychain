# Sales and Supply Chain Performance Optimization
Analysis of retail sales, transfers, and warehouse operations to optimize supply chain performance, track sales trends, and improve stock and supplier management.

### SUMMARY
#### Sales Performance:
- The analysis shows that the warehouse generates higher sales (79.84%) than retail channels (20.16%). This could be due to bulk purchasing, lower prices, or operational efficiency in the warehouse.
- The first(34.82%) and third(49.67%) quarters have recorded more sales. This indicates seasonality or high demand for specific products.

#### Retail Transfers and Supply Chain Efficiency:
- From my analysis, there is a clear positive correlation between retail sales and retail transfers. As retail sales increase, retail transfers tend to increase as well.
- The current transfer system appears to function efficiently because retail transfers effectively meet demands

### RECOMMENDATIONS
- Streamline warehouse operations to reduce delivery times, improve order accuracy, and enhance the overall customer experience.
- The warehouse should always be well-stocked with high-demand items.
- To boost retail sales, we should consider improving the in-store experience or offering personalized services
