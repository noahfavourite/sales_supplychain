# Sales and Supply Chain Performance Optimization
Analysis of retail sales, transfers, and warehouse operations to optimize supply chain performance, track sales trends, and improve stock and supplier management.

### SUMMARY
#### Sales Performance:
- The analysis shows that the warehouse generates higher sales (79.84%) than retail channels (20.16%). This could be due to bulk purchasing, lower prices, or operational efficiency in the warehouse.
- The first (34.82%) and third (49.67%) quarters have recorded more sales. This indicates seasonality or high demand for specific products.

#### Retail Transfers and Supply Chain Efficiency:
- My analysis shows a clear positive correlation between retail sales and retail transfers. As retail sales increase, retail transfers tend to increase as well.
- The current transfer system appears to function efficiently because retail transfers effectively meet demands.

#### Suppliers Analysis 
- I found that we have a large number of suppliers compared to the limited product types we distribute. This is because each product or item type is sourced from multiple brands.
- We also have numerous suppliers providing various product brands that are not in demand or being purchased.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
- I propose we focus on suppliers offering popular and high-performing brands, and layoff suppliers providing underperforming or non-selling brands.
- We should focus on the best-selling brands within each product, reducing inventory clutter and improving sales efficiency.
- All warehouses should always be well stocked with high-demand items.
- We should streamline warehouse operations to reduce delivery times, improve order accuracy, and enhance customer experience.
- To boost retail sales, we should consider improving the in-store experience for each retail store.
